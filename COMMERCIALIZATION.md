# Commercialization and Community Value

IDEMO is developed as an open, non-commercial methodological corpus.  
Its primary purpose is **research, education, and the development of a shared conceptual framework**.

## 1. Principles

If, at any point, parts of the IDEMO Corpus are used as a basis for commercial products, services, or licensed derivatives, the project maintainers commit to the following principles:

- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate the nature and scope of commercial use.  
- **Recognition**: Acknowledge meaningful contributors whose work is incorporated.  
- **Fair value-sharing**: Where applicable, consider mechanisms to share benefits with contributors.

> The exact form of any commercial arrangements (including revenue sharing, grants, or other compensation) will depend on context and will be defined separately.

## 2. Contributor Rights

- Contributors whose work is merged into `main` are **recognized as authors of that contribution**.  
- In commercial scenarios, contributors **may be eligible for compensation**, subject to separate agreements.  
- All such arrangements must respect the GPG-signed commit history as proof of contribution.

## 3. Licensing

- **IDEMO text and documentation**: Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)  
- **IDEMO code contributions**: dual-license — non-commercial use plus possibility of commercial licensing under separate agreements.  

> This document describes the **intent and guiding principles**. It is not a legally binding contract.  

## 4. Documentation of Commercial Use

- All commercial uses must be **publicly documented** (for example, in this repository under `COMMERCIALIZATION.md`).  
- Transparency ensures that contributors and the community can verify how their work is applied.

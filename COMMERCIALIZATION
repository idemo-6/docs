# Commercialization and Community Value

IDEMO is developed as an open, non-commercial methodological corpus.

The primary goal of the project is research, education,
and the development of a shared conceptual framework.

If, at any point, parts of the IDEMO Corpus are used as a basis
for commercial products, services, or licensed derivatives,
the project maintainers commit to the following principles:

• Transparency regarding the nature and scope of such use  
• Recognition of meaningful contributors  
• Consideration of fair value-sharing mechanisms, where applicable  

The exact form of any commercial arrangements (including
revenue sharing, grants, or other forms of compensation)
will depend on the context and will be defined separately.

This document expresses intent and principles,
not a legally binding obligation.

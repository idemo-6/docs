# Contributing to IDEMO

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the IDEMO project.

## 1. General Principles

IDEMO is developed as an open, non-commercial methodological corpus.  
The primary goal of the project is research, education, and the development of a shared conceptual framework.

## 2. Contributor Workflow

- All changes should be submitted via **fork → pull request**.  
- All commits must be **GPG-signed** to unambiguously establish authorship.  
- Pull requests are subject to review (tests, linters, formatting).  
- Any changes merged into `main` are **considered contributions** to IDEMO.

## 3. Licensing

- **Text and documentation**: Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).  
- **Code contributions**: IDEMO Code **dual-license** — non-commercial use plus possibility of commercial licensing under separate agreements.

By submitting a contribution (text, documentation, specifications, examples, or code), you agree that:

1. Your contribution is your original work, or you have the right to submit it.  
2. Your contribution will be licensed under the same license as the IDEMO Corpus.  
3. Your contribution may become part of the canonical IDEMO Corpus.  

## 4. Commercial Use

- The IDEMO Corpus is **not intended for commercial use** without explicit permission.  
- In the event that commercial use or licensing of IDEMO materials is considered, the project maintainers recognize the value of community contributions.  
- Contributors whose changes are merged into commercial products **may be eligible for fair value-sharing**, proportional to their contribution (verified via GPG commits in `main`).  
- All commercial arrangements (revenue sharing, grants, or other forms of compensation) are defined **separately in a commercial agreement**.

## 5. Principles of Transparency

- All commercial usage must be **publicly documented** (e.g., in `COMMERCIALIZATION.md`).  
- Any commercial agreements require **consent of all involved contributors**.
